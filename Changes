Revision history for Perl extension CLIP::Pkg::Download.

1.2.6 Mon Oct 22 2013
	- add a parameter in clippkg_gen_packages_gz, to optionally include SHA checksums
	in the output.

1.2.5 Mon Oct 21 2013
	- export clippkg_gen_packages_gz(), formerly (internal) gen_packages_gz().

1.2.4 Fri Oct 18 2013
	- optimize the package indexation phase of clippkg_gen_mirror(),
	by reading the previous Packages.gz, and only extracting fields
	for packages that have actually been added, rather than for all
	packages present in the mirror (most of which are already 
	referenced in the old Packages.gz).

1.2.3 Mon Oct 07 2013
	- create $mirror_base/mirrors/flags/$dist_$part flags
	when a new packages from $dist:$part are merged into 
	a mirror.

1.2.2 Mon Oct 07 2013
	- run clippkg_prune() systematically at the end of 
	clippkg_update_mirror(), even when no updates have
	been downloaded.

1.2.1 Fri Jul 19 2013
	- when the first attempt to download a package fails, 
	retry with only remote mirrors, excluding local mirrors
	from e.g. other jails.

1.1.16 Thu Jun 14 2012
	- add additional param to clippkg_update_mirror() : error
	string reference.

1.1.15 Thu Mar 22 2012
	- add Category-fr: to Packagez.gz.

1.1.14 Thu Jul 28 2011
	- add Homepage: to Packages.gz fields

1.1.12 Mon Jan 17 2011
	- better fix for write_pending() : do not create empty lines.

1.1.11 Tue Nov 03 2010
	- fix write_pending() : missing newline at the end of each line.

1.1.10 Tue Apr 06 2010
	- use clippkg_list_mirror_optional instead of clippkg_list_allowed_optional.

1.1.9  Wed Sep 30 2009
	- fix code width...
	- add CLIP-Jails to supported fields.

1.1.8  Thu Sep 10 2009
	- proper management of the cache 'pending' file when recovering 
	  from an interruption. Do not remove the pending file altogether
	  after 'recovering' files, otherwise those recovered files will
	  be lost if a new interruption occurs.

1.1.7  Mon Aug 31 2009
	- clean up partial downloads before starting a new download sequence,
	  and after each download failure.

1.1.6  Fri Aug 21 2009
	- add Description-fr field to the list of copied fields in 
	  gen_packages_gz()

1.1.5  Fri Jul 17 2009
	- adapt to new CLIP::Pkg::Base 1.18 API (dpkg error recovery code,
	  not used in downloads).

1.1.4  Tue May 28 2009
	- replace calls to apt-ftparchive with homemade perl code, which
	  does what's needed at least twice as fast.
	- fix propagation of new downloaded configurations, to enable 
	  core update detection.

1.1.3  Tue May 12 2009
	- support configuration dependencies.

1.1.2  Tue Jan 27 2009
	- simplify optional packages download, along the same lines used
	  for installation.
	- do not rely on a configuration's dependencies to list packages that
	  need to be checked, used the apt output instead. This should react
	  better to configurations with incomplete dependencies.

1.1.1  Wed Jan 21 2009
	- fix writing of pending downloads when downloading optional
	  packages

1.1.0  Tue Jan 20 2009
	- support for downloading additionnal optional packages

1.0.0  Wed Oct 22 2008
	- first stable, documented version.

0.0.1  Mon Aug 18 16:31:22 2008

		-AXc -n CLIP::Pkg::Download
